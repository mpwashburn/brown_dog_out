# brown_dog_out
GA project 2: Ruby on Rails. Social app for users to post dog friendly hikes and camping areas.

Heroku link: https://browndogout.herokuapp.com/

Concept: Browndogout.com is a community site that allows users to post hikes and camping areas that are dog friend. Once a user created a profile they would be able to fill out a standarized form on their profile sheet to submit to the site. Their posts would be added to a database so other users can search. Additionally, on their profile, a user would be able to see a list of their posts, and a list of other users' posts that hey have  liked.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. 3 Models: Project consists os three models; User table, Post table, and Like table.
-- Code was writen under respective .rb files for association. However, I did not test it.

2. API end points: Given a pass for Friday presentation

3. Signin/login/logout capability: All three were created, with authentification 'has_secure_password'. However, I did not test editin restrictions.

4. RESTful routes: Fully implemented with sign-up.

5. Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data: YES

6. Trello and user stories: Although I did create user story cards, I did not fully implement Trello in this project planning: https://trello.com/b/yyIStzI3

7. Wireframes: at https://trello.com/b/yyIStzI3

8. CSS frame work:Bootstrap


Unsolved Problems:
Where do I begin! Although my databases take and save information, I have not displayed my posts anywhere, nor do I have CRUD fully implented with Post.

I have created a Like DB, but have not done anything with it.

I do not have any unique styling, and currently confused between basic HTML/CSS use learned earlier on, with that of Bootstrap and where everthing is at.

Authentification has to be built out and tested further.
